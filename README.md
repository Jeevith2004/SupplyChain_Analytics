#Problem Statement: Enhancing Supply Chain Efficiency & Profitability through Data-Driven Insights

In modern supply chain management, inefficiencies in order fulfillment, delivery delays, and inventory turnover can lead to increased costs and reduced profitability. Companies struggle with shipment delays, suboptimal inventory management, and fluctuating profit margins due to a lack of real-time visibility into key performance metrics.

This project aims to analyze, optimize, and improve supply chain operations by leveraging Excel and Power BI  to uncover bottlenecks, improve delivery performance, and enhance revenue insights. By integrating data-driven decision-making, businesses can reduce late deliveries, optimize shipping strategies, and boost overall profitability.
